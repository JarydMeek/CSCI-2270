CSCI 2270 Final Project
Collin Graham and Jaryd Meek

All Test Driver files are in the "testDriverFiles" folder, and will work when run there.
g++ -std=c++11 bstdriver.cpp ../BST.cpp

Run the entire project using the mainDriver.cpp files
g++ -std=c++11 mainDriver.cpp hashTableChaining.cpp LinkedList.cpp hashTableQuadratic.cpp hashTableLinear.cpp BST.cpp -o RunTests

DataSets folder contains the given data sets, as well as the "fixed" data, where rows and columns are flipped, to allow graphing of 40k pts of data

In the report folder contains the final report, as well as all of the data used to make graphs.
